### Before proceeding make sure that you have installed kitty, starship and fish shell.

Step 1: Go to home directory then press CTRL+H to see the hidden directory, now look for .config directory. 
Step 2: Paste the 'config.fish' file to ~/.config/fish/ directory.
Step 3: Paste the 'kitty.conf' file into ~/.config/kitty/ directory, if not present then create manually.
Step 4: For changing the terminal prompt style paste the 'starship.toml' file into ~/.config/ directory.
Step 5: Now relaunch the kitty terminal and see the magic!

# Correct path for all the mentioned files are:
  
  config.fish     -->   ~/.config/fish/config.fish
  kitty.conf      -->   ~/.config/kitty/kitty.conf
  starship.toml   -->   ~/.config/starship.toml
