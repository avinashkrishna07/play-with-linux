<h3>Installation Tool or Medium</h3>

> Personally, I would recommend you to go with **Ventoy**.<br> 
> Because it allows you to keep **multiple ISOs** of operating system and even other data and files, within the same pendrive.<br>
> You don't need to flash or format your pendrive multiple times for making it bootable.<br>
> Install **ventoy** on a pendrive and just paste the downloaded **disk image file** of operating system in **pendrive**.<br>
> To access installation guides and instructional resources on utilizing this tool, please refer to this [<ins>link</ins>](https://www.ventoy.net/en/doc_start.html).<br>
> If you are already using **arch based distro** then there is a package named as `ventoy-bin` in **AUR**.<br>
>> For installation guides on arch based distro go through this [<ins>link</ins>](https://github.com/avinashkrishna07/play-with-linux/blob/main/USEFULGUIDES.md#ventoy-installation).<br>

<h3>Save your System Configuration</h3>

> **Konsave** is best tool for preserving your system configuration.<br>
> This tool serves as a valuable asset for reinstating previous configurations in the event of accidental corruption of the operating system or during the process of a fresh installation.<br>
