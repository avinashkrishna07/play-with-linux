<h1>Steps to execute the scripts</h1>
<p>You have the option to manually include or exclude packages by adding or removing
  their names based on the package manager which is on your linux distro i.e <b>apt</b> or <b>pacman</b>,
  prior to executing the installation script.</p>
<p>Just make a copy or download the script and create your own customized version.<br> Additionally,
  remember to grant executable permissions to the script before running it.</p>

  #

### Open the terminal and go to the path location where you have downloaded or stored the script

> Now, run the command `chmod u+x script_name` or `chmod 766 script_name` for assinging **execute permission** to the script.<br>
> Then **execute the script** by running command `bash script_name` or `./script_name`.
